This is easy to set up... Copy this file structure to your project and use
the following lines in your HTML to create a cached file on your system
containing all CSS or all JS in just one file... Which means less HTTP-calls
from the browser and a faster browsing experience.

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{index.php}/compress/css" />
	<script type="text/javascript" src="{index.php}/compress/js"></script>

Then add your files and folders in /system/application/controllers/compress.php.

Make sure that the directories you specifiy for the cache files are writeble by
the script.
